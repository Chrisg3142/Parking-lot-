This was a small school project that was not assigned to me but it seemed like a challenge due to my lack of knowledge on lists and how to manipulate them with data. 
This project is a parking lot system where the user enters their plate for their veichle and enter the parking lot and are given a specific floor and spot, a 'radom' vehicle also leaves when you enter.
I attempted this project and it took me about two hours to code and one hours to clean it up and make it more effective and fixing some bugs within the lists my original code was three times the size of the code I have now.
I learned as I coded and that is why the code was able to be lowered to a certasin extent I will come back to this to make it more effective and have more fun with it.
